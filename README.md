Learning Backend Development and Connecting to MongoDB
This GitHub repository documents my journey into the world of backend development, my experience with Postman, and my accomplishment of creating my own server while connecting it to a MongoDB database.

#class 1
  What I've Learned
  Backend Development: I've delved into the world of backend development, which is the part of a software application that runs on the server, handling tasks like data storage, processing, and security.
  
  Postman: I've explored Postman, a powerful tool for testing and documenting APIs. It has been a game-changer in understanding how different parts of a software system communicate with each other.
  
  Server Creation: I've successfully set up my own server. This means I can now handle requests from clients (like web or mobile apps) and send back the necessary data.
  
  MongoDB Connection: I've connected my server to a MongoDB database. This is where the application stores and retrieves data, making it accessible to users.

Learning Web Backend and Implementing POST Requests with MongoDB
This GitHub repository serves as a documentation of my exploration into web backend development, my journey through creating a structured folder system, and my experience implementing POST requests that store data in a MongoDB database.

What I've Learned
Web Backend Development: I've delved into web backend development, which is the engine behind web applications. It's responsible for processing requests and delivering data to clients.

Folder Structure: I've understood the importance of organizing a project's files and folders. A well-structured layout is crucial for maintaining and scaling web applications.

POST Requests: I've successfully implemented POST requests. This allows users or other applications to send data to the server for storage or processing.

MongoDB Integration: I've connected my backend to a MongoDB database, enabling data storage and retrieval. This is a crucial aspect of many web applications.

How to Use This Repository
In this repository, you will find:

Folder Structure: I've created a clear and organized folder structure for my project. This can serve as a template or inspiration for structuring your own projects.

Code Samples: I've included code examples and scripts that demonstrate how I implemented POST requests and connected them to MongoDB. These can serve as a reference for your own projects.

Documentation: I've added explanations and guides for various aspects of web backend development, including POST requests and MongoDB integration.
